    [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "audio_session":
      In Podfile:
        audio_session (from `.symlinks/plugins/audio_session/ios`)

    Specs satisfying the `audio_session (from `.symlinks/plugins/audio_session/ios`)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
