WARNING: [Processor] Library '/home/runner/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/androidx.media2/media2-session/1.2.1/f927563711e36371c19b2e86fb7ccf1c3f259ca4/media2-session-1.2.1.aar' contains references to both AndroidX and old support library. This seems like the library is partially migrated. Jetifier will try to rewrite the library anyway.
 Example of androidX reference: 'androidx/media2/session/MediaBrowser$Builder'
 Example of support library reference: 'android/support/v4/media/session/MediaSessionCompat$Token'
